    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an HB-1 visa will get certified or denied based on the company sponsoring the applicant. The dataset we are using for this project contains 25 columns of data spanning from 2011-2018 filed by various companies and contains features such as the employer and work’s state and location, as well as SOC code, information about wages, and many other relevant details. We will be performing EDA on this dataset to better understand which features are more or less important in determining whether an application is certified or denied. We plan on using ML models, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN to build a predictive model that can classify H1-B applications based on the sponsoring company. The success of our models will be measured by using F1 score and ROC-AUC with accuracy calculated for comparison purposes. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "H1-B visas is a very important program that allows companies in the U.S to hire specialized and talented foreign workers in technical positions<a name=\"mpinote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#mpinote). This is extremely important for companies when they want to fill key roles in their organizations. Though many people understand the importance of this visa type there are those who see threats. One of the biggest threats is that it can displace workers and depress wages. \n",
    "The USCIS provides a set of guidelines for applying for the H1-B and other Visa types but more importantly, it provides a set of rules that employers must follow. \n",
    "With many people from outside of the U.S. wanting to work here, there is plenty of demand for ways to predict if you can get an H1B visa. So, there has been some research that has aimed to predict whether an employee will have their H1B application certified or not. \n",
    "One research paper<a name=\"iqbalnote\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#iqbalnote) used primarily characteristics about the employee and their job position to predict this. The features were the employee name, petition year, SOC code, job name, wage, full-time position(boolean), and work site. It used K-Means Clustering to analyze the dataset and tested two classifiers, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression; it found that Logistic Regression classifies better with an accuracy score of 87%, while Random Forest Classifier had an accuracy score of 72%\n",
    "\n",
    "Another research article<a name=\"rananote\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#rananote) used characteristics of the applicant, the company, and industry they were to create a prediction model that accurately predicts whether an H1B application will be certified, denied, withdrawn or certified withdrawn. This research team used seven ML models including, Decision Tree, SVM, Neural Network, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and C5.0, as well as a machine ensemble method (combining all the models to make a better classifier). The models are trained and tested on applications/petitions from 2015 to 2017 and utilizes 20 features. These 20 features included information about the employer and worksite location, wages, H1-B dependence and SOC name (names for different occupation classifications). For all models, train test split is 70-30 and validation of the models is done with 10-fold cross validation. The results from this team states that C5.0 had best single model accuracy, 94.62%, but machine ensemble method had 95.4% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final research paper<a name=\"paulnote\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#paulnote) we found focuses on trying to come to a conclusion of why there was a surge in denial rates after the 2017 “Buy American and Hire American” Executive Order (EO). This article uses 4 ML models, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Linear Discriminant, and Naïve Bayes. The validation of these models were computed through 5-fold cross validation. The model uses both firm and applicant characteristics. Applicant characteristic features span from education level (degree), occupation, and nationality. The firm features consist of the state in which they are in, the location of their headquarters, whether they are publicly traded, and H1 Dependent. Out of the 4 ML models used, it found that linearly dependent models outperformed XGBoost. Logistic Regression had the best accuracy, with 93% in the pre-treatment, and 82% in the post-treatment, Linear Discriminant had 91% in the pre-treatment and 81% in the post-treatment, Naïve Bayes had 92% in the pre-treatment and 81% in the post-treatment, and finally XGBoost had 90% in the pre-treatment and 80% in the post-treatment. Overall these results are fairly similar, however XGBoost takes into account potential non-linearities decision-boundaries, which is why for the rest of the paper they focused on the best linear model, logistic regression and also XGBoost.\n",
    "In conclusion, the H1-B visa program is one of the most critical parts of the US economy because it allows foreign workers to fill in technical roles. Although we see this as a benefit, the program has received lots of criticism for some displacement of American workers and low wages. Due to this the USCIS created a list of guidelines to apply for the H1-B visa program. Based on these guidelines and access to the datasets, many machine learning models were created to predict the chance of approval for this visa. What makes our approach different is that we will be focusing on employer/company metrics, rather than employee/applicant metrics as focused on in the articles above. "

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem statement: How accurately can we predict whether an H1B application will be certified or denied, based on the size, location, industry, and sales volume of the company sponsoring the employee and the details of the job being applied for (wage, job title, full time status)? What classifier can predict H-1B acceptance/denial with the greatest accuracy score? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem statement’s motivation is to find whether the metrics of the H1B sponsoring employer have a significant predictive value on approval odds of the H1B application and whether using this information can generate better predictions than not using them. All research data we have seen thus far do not use demographic/financial info of the company, rather they use demographic data from applicants. We think this is likely an oversight as H-1B applications are submitted by companies rather than individuals so we hypothesize company metrics might be more useful than individual demographic information in the context of H-1B applications."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of being able to compare our H-1B classification models, we will be using accuracy as our first metric.  Accuracy is simply the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances in the dataset. Mathematically, it can be represented as: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) However, accuracy will not be our primary metric for overall evaluation because the classes are imbalanced. Due to this we will be using F1-score and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) to evaluate overall performance. We feel the costs of false positives and false negatives are roughly equivalent in the context of our model being purely for analytical purposes and not for commercial use. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balanced measure of the model's performance and can be represented as: T2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). The AUC-ROC measures the performance of the model across all possible classification thresholds, and is useful when the threshold for classification is not known. In the context of H-1B visa application prediction, the goal will be to identify a threshold that maximizes both precision and recall since we assume them to be equally important. The AUC-ROC also measures the model's performance across all possible classification thresholds, and is calculated by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold values. The AUC-ROC provides a single number (between 0 and 1) that summarizes the model's performance across all thresholds, making it a useful metric for overall evaluation. F1-Score and AUC-ROC will be used for model evaluation while accuracy will primarily be used for comparison with past models with the same goal."

    "\n",
    "Our approach to solving our classification problem will be to generate multiple models, refine those models’ hyperparameters, and then select the best model for final prediction evaluation based on test data unseen by any of the models to see generalization performance. We will first do an 80-20 train(/valid)-test split to allow for better model evaluation later since our dataset is so large. To solve our classification problem we will use several models from SciKit Learn and select the best model after finding the best hyperparameters for each of the models using gridsearch. The models we have in mind for classification are Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN. Since we do not know the distribution of our high dimensional dataspace, we will be thinking of these models but our decision may be and will likely be influenced by what we find in our initial EDA of the data and EDA will also provide insight into feature importance. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, PCA will likely need to be performed as dimensionality reduction before being input into training the models to improve performance. Each model’s best hyperparameters will be found using random search and then gridsearch after which each model will be compared against each other by using k-fold cross validation on the train/validation data split (80% of the data). After which each model will be tested on the completely unseen testing data split (20%) to determine generalization performance of each model. Our best resulting model will be selected with a heavy emphasis on generalization performance. We will be aiming to have better performance than the performance of previous H-1B prediction algorithms we found and will find in our research- the best of which we have seen has an accuracy of 96% for example.

    "There are several ethics and privacy concerns with the dataset we have chosen regarding H1-B Non Immigrant Labour Visa. The dataset that we have is anonymous, however, with the features described, employees could be re-identified, as the dataset contains information regarding the city, state, and zip code of both the employer and employee. However, to address this, we will refrain from using information of the employee in our project. The dataset also avoids proxy discrimination, as we are not using features such as race, origin, sex, and age, rather using attributes from the company. As far as bias, since we are mainly going to be using columns regarding the employer and the case status, and disregarding columns related to the employee. As we are reducing the number of columns used, we could be missing some potential variables that could lead to biased predictions in our results regarding the approval of visas. To address this, we will choose models that are less prone to bias and use evaluation metrics that mitigate bias."
